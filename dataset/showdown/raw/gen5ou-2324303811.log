|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Nobody else does
|c|☆a014646094|its most comon moves are thunder and wish
|c|☆a014646094|there's sample sets with it
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Have to remind myself your playing on easy mode
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Cause thunder never misses
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|And rocks help you every turn
|c|☆a014646094|it is not my fault you made a team that is weak to rocks
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Its mot weak to rocks
|c|☆a014646094|it is not my fault you refuse to deal with rocks
|c|☆a014646094|it is your fault for this not mines
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Its weak to cringe players that spam encore tricj taunt
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Rocks arent its weakness
|c|☆a014646094|dude look at your team
|c|☆a014646094|your running stall
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|And i will die on the hill you made loads of mispalys
|c|☆a014646094|what do you expect me to do
|c|☆a014646094|could you punish them?
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|All you did was jsut spam u turn anywya which tells you whats in every turn
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|As i said. No rocks you are 6-0d
|c|☆a014646094|could you punish me just u turning with rachi into loom
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|All tjar matters to me is the quality of the clicks
|c|☆a014646094|yeah and yours were bad cause you couldn't stop me
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|And everytime you clicked it was either a bad one, or just soamming u turn to tell you whats in
|c|☆a014646094|you couldn't do anything to me just u turn to loom
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Yeah i could without rocks
|c|☆a014646094|you lost to the same thing for 50+ turns
|c|☆a014646094|"i could without rocks" buddy every team has rocks
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Only because focus punch has 32pp and you were being carried by rocks
|c|☆a014646094|and if you belive that than run a spinner
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Withit rocks your dumbass u turns into breloom do nothing
|j| Shweinerei
|c|☆a014646094|dude if for you to win is for me to not click moves that you have to be ready for your the worst player
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Youre missing the point
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Half these sets arent even legitimate anyway
|c|☆a014646094|what point are you making
|c| Shweinerei|what u say makes no sense bro, u always say "if" but the reality is that ur team just lacks a spinner
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Aside from th3 non sets whete youve just soammed protect on everything
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Shwwinerei who asked you for your opinion
|c|☆a014646094|could you stop it?
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Nobody
|c|☆a014646094|i mean nobody asked for your dumbass takes
|c| Shweinerei|and if u cant deal with rocks then get rid of it and be able the remove them
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Its not a dumbass take
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|1) unsets
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|2) bad plays but carried by free chip
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|3) no need to predict when the game tells you exactly what mon I have in at all times
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|None of these are dumb takes
|c| Shweinerei|lol this is the funniest conversation ive read in a while :D
|c|☆a014646094|you couldn't stop me just u turn spaming to loom
|c|☆a014646094|why would i do something else
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|U turn spamming to look against an amoongus is dumb
|l| Shweinerei
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|And only because you also spammed protect on everything (unset)
|c|☆a014646094|why would i hard switch toad just so i can switch again
|c|☆a014646094|yeah cause i get free healing
|c|☆a014646094|could you stop it?
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Dude you kept switching into loom one of the worst mons ever
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Against a counter
|c|☆a014646094|if not it's a good play
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Spamming protect and free chip damage
|c|☆a014646094|yeah that's a good play
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Without rocks the game teaches you not to be so braindead
|c|☆a014646094|the fuck
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|No its an awful play
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Without rocks how do hou win?
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|You dont
|c|☆a014646094|so getting free damage is bad
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Yes
|c|☆a014646094|damn so why didn't you win
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Because tou didnt earn it
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|You didnt earn any of that damage
|c|☆a014646094|i mean i clicked the move
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|You jist braindead switched with u turn
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|And without hazards you learn that tjis is braindead against dual regen
|c|☆a014646094|and you couldn't do shit cause your dumbass built a team with no spin
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Especially when you just keep going to breloom against amoongus
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Hazaeds are for noobs
|c|☆a014646094|yeah how do you think regen gets punished
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Ive beaten many players with hazards on my side
|c|☆a014646094|by haz
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|No It gets punished by...
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Oppjnent pickikg two mons that break jt
|c|☆a014646094|or knock or bun
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|And clickikg good moves
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Yeah you didnt do.any of yhat
|c|☆a014646094|yeah cause you couldn't punish it
|c|☆a014646094|that was the safe paly
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Theres literally nothijg you would havr done eithout rocks other than just relentlessly spam u turn
|c|☆a014646094|switch it in protect to see what move your locked into
|c|☆a014646094|switch out wish something
|c|☆a014646094|repeat
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Protect on 4 mons. Jirachi wiyh no stab just wish thunder
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Encore
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Trick
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Taunt
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Dude youre ceinge af
|c|☆a014646094|i did that for 67 turns
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|You did nothing
|c|☆a014646094|and you couldn't do shit
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Other than wait for hazards to bail you out
|c|☆a014646094|that isn't my fault you built a team weak to sub punch loom
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|If mega sableye was ok the team.what then?
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Wheres your dumb u turn spam then?
|c|☆a014646094|mega sableye?
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Its not weak to subpunch loom
|c|☆a014646094|a mon you can't even bring
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Thats thee irony
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Yes but it stops hazards
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|And then exposes YOU
|c|☆a014646094|yeah it stops hazards
|c|☆a014646094|can you use it in this gen?
|c|☆a014646094|yes or no?
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Becayse at that piint you actually have to make your clicks count
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|And if you click badly you get punished
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|I was clicking bettwr than you every turn but getting punished
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|You cant even see the irony
|c|☆a014646094|so because if you can use a mon that dosen't even exist that
|c|☆a014646094|i'm bad
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Tel me what youd do if hazards werent up
|c|☆a014646094|the same thing
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|Exactly
|c|☆a014646094|and even than it dosen't matter
|c|☆AltTestingAlt|And it achieves mothing
