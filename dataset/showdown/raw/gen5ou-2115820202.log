|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|how the hell am i supposed to reach 1600
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|i was 20 - 0, then i ran into you
|c|☆sunraku2|Why do you need that?
|c|☆sunraku2|Ups
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|because the GXE required is 85%
|c|☆sunraku2|For what?
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|for the cloy suspect test
|c|☆sunraku2|To ban?
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/cloyster-suspect-voter-identification.3741817/

|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|not even a ban
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|because god forbid we change something in BW right?
|c|☆sunraku2|Puff
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|maybe you should ladder too if you care enough to do it
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|i care enough to do it
|c|☆sunraku2|I have been using the same team since bw launched
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|this one?
|c|☆sunraku2|Yup
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|well it's solid

|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|yeye
|c|☆sunraku2|Fucking corrector
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|isn't it crazy how people say that bw1 was a better meta than bw2?
|c|☆sunraku2|It was
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|clearly, there is a problem right?
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|how did we degrade the metagame
|c|☆sunraku2|Hahaha
|c|☆sunraku2|Not degrade
|c|☆sunraku2|More mons and sets were released
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|i guess
|c|☆BWC kyubthagod|but
